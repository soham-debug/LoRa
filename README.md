# LoRa

In our study of LoRaWAN research papers, we identified a drawback where packets are sent randomly to the gateway, resulting in decreased throughput and inefficient resource utilization. To address this, we propose selecting the optimal channel instead of relying on random selection, thereby increasing throughput. We employ a game theory approach and RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) to dynamically select the optimal channel from the available ones, enhancing throughput and reducing packet loss. The game theory model considers factors like signal strength, the utility of each channel, and historical data transmission success rates. By continuously monitoring these parameters, the algorithm selects channels that maximize throughput and minimize packet loss. Initially, the gateway evaluates the RSSI from all sensors, while sensor nodes also assess their own RSSI from the gateway's signals. The gateway provides RSSI feedback to the sensors, allowing each sensor to calculate a utility function for each channel based on RSSI values. A higher utility indicates a better channel for communication. Sensors use this utility to select channels with the best signal quality and minimal interference, ensuring efficient communication and resource use.
